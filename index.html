            <p id="intro-text">Hey everyone! I'm Manny, and I've been hooked on rock music and electric guitar since last December. It all started with watching guitar covers of my favorite songs, which ignited a passion in me. On my 16th birthday, my parents gave me my first electric guitar, and from then on, I delved into self-teaching. Surprisingly, mastering the guitar was easier than I thought, thanks to five key steps I discovered. Now, I'm excited to share my journey to proficiency with you all.</p>

                <p id="step-1-description-text">As I embark on my electrifying journey into the world of the electric guitar, I must take a critical first step: tuning my instrument. I ensure my guitar is finely tuned to perfection before I think about strumming my first chord or riff. I grab my guitar and prepare to unleash its potential. But wait, I can't do it alone. I need AMP to tune my guitar. Together, they form the sonic landscape, allowing me to amplify my sound and explore a world of tones and textures. With my guitar and AMP ready, it's time to plug in and power up. But before I do, I take a moment to select the perfect pick, the unacknowledged hero of my musical journey.  With my guitar in tune and my spirit aflame, I'm ready to ignite the stage and unleash my musical destiny upon the world.</p>

The final step is to utilize tools like voice memos or record yourself with your phone or iPad playing the songs you've been practicing. Whether it's a heartfelt ballad or a rocking riff, I record my version to track my development and share my music with others. Set up your recording device, ensuring clarity and quality. Don't worry about perfection! Embrace the process and let your passion shine through. Listening back to your recordings offers valuable insights into your playing. Celebrate your successes and learn from your mistakes, using each recording as a stepping stone towards mastery. With each capture, you'll document your progress and deepen your connection to the music and your instrument. That's how I taught myself to play the electric guitar!</p>
