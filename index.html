            <p id="intro-text">Hey everyone! I'm Manny, and I've been hooked on rock music and electric guitar since last December. It all started with watching guitar covers of my favorite songs, which ignited a passion in me. On my 16th birthday, my parents gave me my first electric guitar, and from then on, I delved into self-teaching. Surprisingly, mastering the guitar was easier than I thought, thanks to six key steps I discovered. Now, I'm excited to share my journey to proficiency with you all.</p>
